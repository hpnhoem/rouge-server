Rouge Licenses Folder
---------------------

This folder contains the licenses used by the various libraries found
in RougeServer and the corresponding drivers. A complete up-to-date
list of what license is associate to which library can be found at

 http://code.google.com/p/rouge-server/wiki/Libraries

Note the Rouge Server itself is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
Most the libraries are associate under the MIT or Apache license, with
the big exception with is license under the GPL 2.0, but remains 
compatible under the FOSS exception (see link below)

As the author of Rouge Server, I am very concerned with licenses being
properly used and credits being properly given. If you see any violation
of licensing rights, please contact me at rouge@adinfo.qc.ca.
